# Image Uploader Project

I created this project based on devchallenges.io. This project is an Image Uploader where you can either drag and drop a file onto the designated area or use the standard method of clicking on the image file. The backend is built using Express and MongoDB, while
the frontend is developed using React and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the 'backend' folder.
2. Run the following command to start the backend server:

- npm run dev
     or
- yarn dev

Once the backend is running, navigate to the 'frontend' folder.
Run the following command to start the frontend development server:

- npm run dev
     or
- yarn dev
